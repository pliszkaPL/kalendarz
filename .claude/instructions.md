# Claude Code Instructions

## Start Here

At the beginning of each session, read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) in project root.

## Workflow

1. Read `AGENTS.md` → understand project structure
2. Read `PROJECT.md` → understand current state
3. Check `docs/work/` → find active tasks
4. Use `Makefile` → run and test

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | AI rules, navigation |
| `PROJECT.md` | Project context, status |
| `.ai/prd.md` | Requirements |
| `.ai/architecture.md` | System design |
| `docs/work/` | Active EPICs/STORYs/TASKs |
| `docs/adr/` | Architecture decisions |

## Rules

- Docs first, tests second, implementation third
- Use Makefile commands
- Update task status in `docs/work/`
- Create ADR for technology decisions
- Follow conventions in `AGENTS.md`
